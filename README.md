## Project Description

a. Problem Statement

Thousands of houses are sold and bought everyday. There are some questions every buyer/seller asks himself like: What is the actual price that this house deserves? Am I paying a fair price?

b. Best Possible Solution

* Housing Expert

* Intuition About House

* Using Machine Learning

c. Introduction About Project

* House Price prediction are very stressful work as we have to consider different things while buying a house like the structure and the rooms kitchen parking space and gardens. People donâ€™t know about the factor which influence the house price. But by using the Machine learning we can easily find the house which is to be prefect for us and helps to predict the price accurately

* Impute/Remove missing values or Null values (NaN)

* Remove unnecessary and corrupted data.

* Date/Text parsing if required.
